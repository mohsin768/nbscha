Cheques should be addressed to the residence.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Non payment on account after 30 days may warrant a discharge notice of 15 days.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>Comfort and Clothing Allowance</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Some homes that can operate for the government rate ($####/mth) give a comfort and clothing allowance to residents of $###/mo. Due to our operational costs, special programs and payroll costs our rates are higher than the government rate. The residence does not handle any part of the comfort and clothing factor and has a set rate for lodging and care of $####/mth.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>MISCELLANEOUS POLICIES AND SERVICES</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>Valuables</strong><br />\r\n	This residence cannot be responsible for any valuables. If a resident or family member insists on having valuables, they are responsible to protect them.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>Scent Policy</strong><br />\r\n	Scented products are harmful to those with allergies, environmental sensitivities, chronic heart or lung disease. In support of its commitment to the provision of healthy and safe environment for residents, staff, volunteers and visitors, this residence supports a scent reduction policy.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>pets</strong><br />\r\n	Pet visits are encouraged as long as the owner assumes full responsibility of clean up, restrains the pet on a leash and pet immunizations are up to date.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>Alcoholic Beverages</strong><br />\r\n	The consumption of alcoholic beverages is permitted with a physician&rsquo;s written order. All alcohol must be kept locked in the medication cupboard unless special arrangements are agreed upon.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>Smoking Policy</strong><br />\r\n	This residence provides a smoke free environment to support the health and safety of all persons.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>Visiting Hours and Outings for Residents</strong><br />\r\n	This residence has no specific visiting hours. Families may wish to take residents out for a day or overnight. Prior notice is appreciated to allow time for preparation of medication. The residence releases responsibility for resident when off property with family and friends.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>Hairdressing</strong><br />\r\n	Weekly hair care is provided by staff of this residence. Washing, roller sets, and trims are included but not perms. Due to the strong smell of the products, it is appreciated that perms be done off premises when possible. Special arrangements may be possible if resident is not mobile.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>Families</strong><br />\r\n	The residence would like to emphasize the importance of family involvement. We firmly believe that the continued involvement of family and friends plays an important role in enhancing the quality of life for the residents. We welcome children of all ages and if the resident likes animals, we have no objection to their favourite animal visiting. We encourage any suggestions from family to improve the care for our residents.</p>\r\n', 'en'),

(18, 17, 'Disclosure of Employee Information Records', '<p>\r\n	Managers are frequently contacted by third parties for references concerning former employees. Inca case of involuntary termination, a complete refusal or failure to provide a reference may significantly increase the financial risk in the event of litigation. In other cases, an inaccurate reference may, at least theoretically, expose the employer to a libel or slander action from the employee. In Canada, litigation regarding &ldquo;wrongful references&rdquo; is unknown.&nbsp; In the United States, there have been a number of cases where an employee has successfully sued an ex-employer for an inaccurate or biased reference. Despite the lack of litigation in Canada, this type of policy should save management time and reduce the risks of potential legal action. Additionally, employees are assured that no information will be released without their authorization.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n		Given the increasing emphasis on protecting persona information, employers should ensure that training is given to all employees who have access to confidential personnel information. This includes personnel in payroll, accounting, human resource and security. There should be a concerted focus on ensuring that employees understand the company&rsquo;s procedures regarding the handling of personal information.</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n		Employees who do not handle personal information on a routine basis should know what information is considered private and confidential and should be trained to refer any requests to the designated person within the organization. This avoids dangerous &ldquo;off the cuff&rdquo; comments that can expose a company to liability.</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n		Payroll personnel often receive telephone requests for references concerning employees who are applying for credit or loans. No such information should be provided over the telephone unless the employer already has a written authorization from the employee to release such information. In the alternative, payroll personnel can provide a written confirmation on letterhead to be used by the employee.</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n		With respect to requests for job performance references, an important step in minimizing legal risk is to provide written references in the form of a letter addressed to the employee at the time of termination. A copy of the letter should be kept in the employee&rsquo;s file. This ensures that only factual data is contained in the reference and the employee is then at liberty to use the reference as he/she may see fit. Additional copies can be sent out upon written request to the employee, if originals are required.</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n		It is common to designate one person who has full access to employees&rsquo; personnel files as the individual responsible for responding to all reference requests. It need not be the employee&rsquo;s manager.</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n		Employers should refrain from conjecturing about a former employee&rsquo;s potential, ability to do a job, and should never divulge medical or workers&rsquo; compensation information about the employee.</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n		Some companies, especially those with US parents, have adopted a policy of only confirming job titles, job duties, dates of employment and salary levels. In Canada, this type of policy may backfire, since Canadian courts expect that an employer will give an honest reference to assist an employee to find work elsewhere.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n	There are no legislated employment standards related to third party references but federal legislation, the<em> Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents</em> <em>Act (PIPEDA)</em>, which became effective on January 1, 2004 for all provincially-regulated organizations engaged in commercial activities, has implications related to the disclosure of employee personal information to third parties.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Although PIPEDA does not directly affect employee personal information in provincially regulated organizations, employers should consider the principles contained in this legislation and the impact those principles may have on human resources and payroll functions. Prudent employers will use this opportunity to reassess their management practices related to handling employee personal information, particularly as it related to the disclosure of information to third parties.</p>\r\n', 'en'),

(69, 68, ' Probationary Period', '<p>\r\n	<strong>Policy brief &amp; purpose</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Our probationary period policy will define the employment probationary period and explain its meaning for the employee and the company. This practice is designed to allow an introductory period for everyone involved to decide if the hiring of the particular employee was a correct decision and whether the employee should continue working for the company.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>Scope</strong><br />\r\n	This policy applies to all prospective and existing employees of our company.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>Policy elements</strong><br />\r\n	Those who can be placed in an employee probationary period include the following:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n		New employees who have just passed through a hiring process for a permanent position</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n		Current employees who are promoted to a position of higher responsibility</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n		Current employees who have to be disciplined for various reasons</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n	The length of the probationary period will be six months. The probationary period may be extended for reasons that justify this action. The employee will receive formal notification in writing with the reason for the extension and clearly defined objectives.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong><em>New Employees</em></strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n	The company will make an effort to ensure that its hiring procedures serve the purpose of recruiting the best employees for each open position. However, we acknowledge that they are inevitably not always accurate in predicting performance or determining appropriate cultural fit. The probation period for new employees gives both employee and employer enough time to find out if their employment relation will eventually work out to the benefit of both.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>What is the meaning of probation period?</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n	The probationary period definition for new employees is the time between signing an employment contract and being granted permanent employment status. It is a &ldquo;trial period&rdquo; during which the employee is being evaluated as a suitable fit to the position and the company. The new employee will be given consistent feedback and coaching to have the chance to learn their new job and improve during the probationary period. At the end of the probation period (or possibly before that), the supervisor will determine if the employee should be retained in the organization. This decision will be made by appraising the following criteria:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n		The skills, competencies and knowledge of the employee on the job</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n		The employee&rsquo;s progress on given assignments</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n		Their reliability, trustworthiness and other relevant personality characteristics of the employee</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n		The employee&rsquo;s relations and collaboration with subordinates, supervisors and peers</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n	The abovementioned criteria will be assessed with quantitative measures if applicable. Their progress will be documented whenever possible, and the decision to retain them will be at the supervisor&rsquo;s discretion.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong><em>Permanent employees</em></strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n	When an employee has completed their initial probationary period, they are granted permanent employment status. After that they may be placed on probation as part of a disciplinary procedure. The reason for the disciplinary action, ranging from low performance to policy violations, will determine the length of the probationary period. During this period, the employee is obliged to change their behavior or they will be faced with more severe repercussions leading up to termination. The company will help them as much as possible with guidance, feedback and training and will expect them to comply.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	An employee may also be placed in a probationary period if they have been promoted or transferred to a position. The purpose of this is to ensure that the employee is able to complete their new duties. If they are deemed unsuitable, they may be allowed to be demoted or return to their previous position or other solutions may be found.

This may happen if the tactical evaluations of the employee are highly unsatisfying or if the employee engages in behavior that justifies a for-cause dismissal. The employee will be officially notified in writing for the decision to terminate them. The document will explicitly state the reason behind their termination and the expected date it will take effect</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Employees may still have to be dismissed for various reasons, after the end of the probationary period.

(86, 85, 'Employee Wellness', '<p>\r\n	<strong>Policy brief &amp; purpose</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Our employee wellness program policy describes our company&rsquo;s wellness initiatives that promote employee health. We want our employees to have access to wellness resources and a personalized wellness plan.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Employee wellness programs have many benefits. Wellness helps people become more productive. It can reduce the number of sick days employees take and various sickness-related expenses and accidents. But, most importantly, employee wellness is a vital aspect of building a happier workplace.<br />\r\n	&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>Scope</strong><br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	This employee wellness program policy applies to all our employees. We may offer our wellness program as part of a group health plan or separately.<br />\r\n	&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>Policy elements</strong><br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Our company provides a wellness program that promotes employee health and disease prevention. Each employee can have a personalized wellness plan and a variety of wellness resources.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>What is a wellness program for employees?</strong><br />\r\n	Our wellness program has several goals. For example, we want to help our employees:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n		Lose weight<br />\r\n		&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n		Quit smoking<br />\r\n		&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n		Manage stress<br />\r\n		&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n		Lower blood pressure or cholesterol levels<br />\r\n		&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n		Improve their physical strength and stamina</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n	This list isn&rsquo;t exhaustive. We aim to promote every outcome that will make our employees healthier. Some training or courses aim to prevent occupational accidents and promote correct use of equipment and material on the job. These fall under the purview of our workplace health and safety policy.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Wellness resources include any kind of information, advice, activity, facility, equipment and membership that promotes employee health (physical, emotional and psychological) and fitness.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	As part of our wellness program, we may use third-party vendors such as gyms, wellness centers, coaches, physicians and health education providers. Physicians or health experts may ask employees to answer assessment questions and take biometric screenings to determine their health risk and help them follow a suitable program. Questions and screenings are voluntary and regulated.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	We may also host competitions among our employees, like 8-week walking challenge. Participating in these contests is also voluntary.<br />\r\n	&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>Team leaders&rsquo; responsibilities</strong><br />\r\n	Team leaders should work with the HR department to communicate our wellness initiatives to their team members. They should tell their team members:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n		That our company offers a wellness program<br />\r\n		&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n		How and when they can use our wellness resources<br />\r\n		&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n		That they can get personalized wellness plans<br />\r\n		&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n		Who employees can refer to for more details</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n	We advise team leaders to encourage their team members to participate and be open to discuss any concerns when needed.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>Wellness Incentives</strong><br />\r\n	We want to encourage our employees to participate in our wellness programs, so we&rsquo;ll provide employee wellness program incentives. We&rsquo;ll also offer rewards for employees who achieve their wellness objectives, as they&rsquo;re formed in their personalized wellness plan. Incentives and rewards may be:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n		Cash<br />\r\n		&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n		Time off<br />\r\n		&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n		Reductions in insurance premiums<br />\r\n		&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n		Other gifts and awards</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n	Incentives and rewards may be regulated by law. We&rsquo;ll follow legal limitations at all times.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>Employees with Disabilities</strong><br />\r\n	We can make reasonable accommodations for our employees with disabilities to help them have equal access to our wellness program. Our HR department will consult with physicians and wellness experts to help our employees with disabilities have a suitable wellness plan.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	The same applies to employees who can&rsquo;t participate in certain wellness activities due to age, pregnancy or other reason. We want everyone to have access to wellness plans and resources they can use. We&rsquo;ll also pay any wellness incentives to all our employees who participate in our wellness programs without discriminating against protected characteristics.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	We encourage our employees to reach out to our HR department. They can explain their situation and discuss options. These discussions and any relevant information will be kept confidential.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>Legality of wellness program</strong><br />\r\n	Our company will handle any health insurance and wellness plans with attention to relevant legal guidelines.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>Genetic information and disability</strong><br />\r\n	Confidentiality and respect to our employees&rsquo; rights are important to us. We won&rsquo;t:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n		use any genetic information and disability status to disadvantage our employees in any way.</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n		use wellness incentives in exchange for information on our employees&rsquo; health condition or that of their family.</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n		try to coerce employees into providing health information or taking medical examinations.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n	We will let employees know what health information we need for our wellness program, who will be able to see it and why. All data will be kept confidential and our company will be able to access aggregated data.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	<strong>Voluntary participation</strong><br />\r\n	We encourage employees to participate in our wellness program but their participation is voluntary . There won&rsquo;t be any punishment or adverse action for employees who choose not to use our wellness resources and program.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>Incentives</strong><br />\r\n	Any incentives that encourage employees to participate in our wellness programs will always be within legal guidelines. We&rsquo;ll give the same incentive to all employees who participate in our wellness program, regardless of disability or health risk</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>Design</strong><br />\r\n	Our wellness program will be designed with employee health in mind.
