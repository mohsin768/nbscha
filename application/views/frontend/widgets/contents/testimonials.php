                    She has been given excellent care over the years.  Her health, medications and diet have been given wonderful attention and our family feels comfort in her care and knows she will be looked after properly.  She has had many urgent episodes over the years and all the staff know her problems and what to look for, and when to call for emergency help.  This has literally saved her life many times during the recent years of her failing health.

                    I have a family member in Special Care Home. My first experience with special care homes was when a friend of mine was looking for a fitting special care home for his brother in law, about 5 years ago. I visited his brother in law often & was quite impressed at the love, support & care he received. So when my friend's time came that she was no longer able to live on her own, the first place I reached out to was the same establishment. I knew it would be a safe for her.

                    COVID has been trying to say the least this past year but my friend was in the best of hands.  Owner & staff have been very informative with each phase of this virus & I was updated with emails & phone calls. I am Grateful to have my Friend (chosen sister) in this forever home where she feels content & safe.
                    I have already told the staff to put 'my name' on their list for when my time comes, I want to feel safe & a part of a family also

                    My daughter has been living in a care home since she was 19 years old. She is now 29 years old. She has cerebral palsy and she is nonverbal. Her condition had progressed in the last few years, she is now on a purred diet due to a choking issue with swallowing and her movement disorder has increased ongoing problems.

                    The care she has received is amazing and as her mom I am very pleased with the care home she lives in. The owner and staff know my daughters needs very well and communicate with me on any issues that come up. I trust their experience and knowledge of my daughter as I would my own. She is lucky to live in such a great place as I know not all of the care homes are so great. The one my daughter lives in is her home and she feels like family there.

                    The owner and staff are well trained and have done an amazing job in dealing with the covid situation. The home is clean and all precautions were taken to keep clients safe and as happy as possible. All regulations surrounding covid were sent out to family and we were updated on any changes in the new color zones. I commend the staff and owner for a job well done during such a difficult time of covid.

                    I myself work with people with disabilities every day but I cannot lift due to injuries so that is why my daughter cannot live with me. I feel she is well cared for and her health and wellbeing are always in the best interest of her care home. I work under the same covid rules myself and I know the care home my daughter is in follows them well. I have had a very good experience with the care home my daughter lives in. Placing your loved one under someone else's care is a difficult and scary decision but I am happy with the choice we made for our daughter and the main thing is she is happy too.
